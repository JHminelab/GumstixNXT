This repository contains documentation and source code for the Gumstix
NXT board.  The repository is currently used for the DES/EMB4 courses
at Mechatronics/Robotics at University of Southern Denmark in Odense
and Sonderborg.

To obtain files from this repository, use the web interface to
download single files or an archive containing all the files.  Better
yet, start using "git" and check out the files using this command:

  git clone git://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/GumstixNXT.git

This gives you read-only access to the files, read-write access will
be covered in class (and given to anyone interested once the DES/EMB4
course has finished, January 2012).  To update whenever a change has
been made, simply run

  git pull

in the newly created "GumstixNXT" directory.
